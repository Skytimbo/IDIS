## 1. Vision & Mission

* **Vision:** To transform the chaos of unstructured documents ("Noise") into clear, actionable **Wisdom** through a private, secure, and intelligent software appliance.
* **Mission:** To empower professionals and small businesses by providing a turnkey solution that automates document processing, mitigates administrative burdens and liability, and provides intuitive access to a structured knowledge baseâ€”all while ensuring absolute data privacy through a local-first, "non-inference" design.

## 2. Core Philosophy

* **ðŸ§  Augmented Intelligence:** The AI's role is to assist, not decide. It surfaces, summarizes, and organizes critical information under a strict "non-inference" policy, ensuring the human expert is always in control.
* **ðŸ”’ Private by Design:** The system is designed to operate as a self-contained appliance. All documents and data are processed and stored locally on the user's hardware.
* **âœ¨ From Noise to Wisdom:** The system moves beyond simple data extraction to provide users with the context and insight needed to make better, faster decisions.

## 3. Architecture Overview

The system is a **Modular Monolith** designed for simplicity and rapid development, running as a set of coordinated services via Docker Compose.

**High-Level Flow:**
[ User ] --> [ QuantaIQ UI (Streamlit) ] <--> [ FastAPI Layer ] <--> [ IDIS Engine (Python) ] <--> [ Database (SQLite) ]
|
V
[ Document Archive (Local Files) ]


* **QuantaIQ UI:** The web-based front-end, built with Streamlit, for all user interaction. It includes modules for Entity/Case Management, Document Search, and more.
* **FastAPI Layer:** A professional API layer (`/api/`) that provides secure, structured endpoints for the Streamlit UI to interact with the backend services.
* **IDIS Engine:** The core backend, including the `watcher_service` for file system monitoring and the `UnifiedIngestionAgent` for document processing.
* **Database:** A local SQLite database (`production_idis.db`) acts as the central "source of truth".
* **Document Archive:** A local directory (`data/archive`) for storing the original, unaltered files.

## 4. Key Components & Data Model

* **CognitiveAgent & Heuristic Engine:** An LLM-powered agent (using GPT-4o via API in the MVP) combined with a deterministic, rule-based engine to accurately classify documents and extract structured JSON data.
* **Unified Uploader:** A single, context-aware component that handles all file uploads, ensuring consistent processing regardless of which module the user is in.
* **Database Schema:** The data model is built around three core concepts:
    * **`entities`**: The subjects of the documents (e.g., clients, patients, companies).
    * **`cases`**: A specific application or project related to an entity (e.g., "Jane Doe - Medicaid App 2025"). Stores metadata like status and deadlines.
    * **`documents`**: The individual files, each linked to an entity and optionally to a case requirement.

## 5. Current Workflow: Medicaid Navigator

The primary workflow implemented in the MVP is the Case Management system for the Medicaid Navigator:

1.  A caseworker navigates to the **Active Case Dashboard**.
2.  They can view all active cases with at-a-glance progress metrics.
3.  They can start a **New Application**, which takes them to the **Entity Management** page to select or create a new client (Entity).
4.  A new **Case** is created for that Entity.
5.  The user enters the detailed **Case View**, which displays a dynamic **Checklist** of required documents.
6.  The user uploads documents, which are processed by the AI.
7.  The user **Assigns** each processed document to a checklist requirement, with a "Trust, but Verify" system providing non-blocking warnings for potential mismatches.
8.  The checklist status updates in real-time.

## 6. Getting Started / Deployment

The application supports both Docker and native deployment options:

### Native Replit Deployment (Recommended)
1. Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment
2. Run the native deployment script: `./deploy-native.sh`
3. Access the application at the URL provided by Replit

### Docker Deployment (Alternative)
1. Ensure Docker is installed and running
2. Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment  
3. Run the Docker deployment script: `./deploy.sh`

The native deployment script (`deploy-native.sh`) is optimized for Replit's environment and includes:
- Automatic directory structure creation
- Database initialization with proper schema
- Smart dependency management
- Conflict detection for running services
- Integrated watcher service management

## 7. Recent Technical Fixes

### Critical Document Archiving Pipeline Fix (2025-07-17)
- **Issue**: Documents uploaded through the UI were failing to archive due to premature temp file deletion.
- **Root Cause**: The `unified_uploader.py` was deleting temporary files before the TaggerAgent could process them for archiving.
- **Fix**: Modified the upload pipeline to preserve temp files until after successful archiving.
- **Impact**: UI uploads now complete the full processing pipeline including automatic archiving to organized folders.

### ContextStore Method Completeness (2025-07-17)
- **Issue**: Missing methods in ContextStore class causing compatibility issues.
- **Fix**: Added missing methods: `get_documents_by_processing_status`, `update_document_fields`, `get_entity`, `add_audit_log_entry`.
- **Impact**: All components now have access to required database operations.

### Complete Case-Document Association Fix (2025-07-17)
- **Issue**: Documents uploaded in Medicaid cases were not appearing in the Case Documents section due to multiple pipeline issues.
- **Root Causes**: 
  - Database column name mismatch (`filename` vs `file_name`)
  - Hardcoded entity IDs in uploader instead of using session state
  - Missing case-document association creation during upload
- **Fixes**:
  - Fixed `get_documents_for_case()` to use correct column name `file_name`
  - Modified `_get_context_parameters()` to use actual entity ID from session state
  - Added `_create_case_document_association()` function to automatically link uploads to current case
  - Added missing `get_document_details_by_id()` method for "View Document" functionality
- **Impact**: Complete case-document workflow now functional - uploads appear in Case Documents section with working "View Document" buttons.

### Enhanced Document Viewer UX (2025-07-17)
- **Issue**: Document viewer showed confusing raw OCR text instead of showcasing excellent AI analysis results.
- **Root Cause**: UI emphasized problematic raw text extraction over valuable structured AI insights.
- **Fixes**:
