# IDIS: Intelligent Document Insight System

## Overview
The Intelligent Document Insight System (IDIS) is designed to transform unstructured documents (medical, legal, operational) into structured, actionable insights. The system employs a modular, privacy-first architecture using an MCP (Model Context Protocol) orchestration approach. The Phase 1 MVP focuses on local processing with targeted API usage for advanced features.

## User Preferences

**For New AI Systems**: This file provides all necessary context to understand the project's evolution, current state, and continue development seamlessly. Pay special attention to the Recent Changes section which chronicles the complete development journey with technical specifics.

## System Architecture
IDIS follows a modular architecture with the following core components:

1. **Context Store**: SQLite database that serves as the persistent storage layer, tracking patients, sessions, documents, agent outputs, and audit trails. This is the central data repository. **[HARDENED - June 2025]**: Complete security refactor with type safety, SQL injection prevention, and V1.3 schema compatibility.

2. **MCP Host Controller**: For Phase 1 MVP, this will be implemented as a simple script (run_mvp.py) that sequentially calls micro-agents rather than a complex orchestrator.

3. **Micro Agents**: Modular Python services (ingestion_agent.py, summarizer_agent.py, classifier_agent.py, tagger_agent.py) that perform specific tasks in the document processing pipeline.

4. **Permissions Model**: JSON configuration file that governs data access based on privacy level, role, and agent type.

5. **Audit Log**: Integrated into the Context Store as a dedicated table to record all system activities for tracking and compliance.

## Key Components

### Unified Cognitive Agent System
- **Purpose**: LLM-powered document processing using OpenAI GPT-4o for structured data extraction
- **Implementation**: 
  - `agents/cognitive_agent.py` - Core LLM integration with V1.3 JSON schema
  - `unified_ingestion_agent.py` - Complete pipeline combining text extraction with cognitive processing
  - `prompts/V1_Cognitive_Agent_Prompt.txt` - Master prompt template for structured extraction
- **Key Features**:
  - Real OpenAI API integration with GPT-4o model
  - V1.3 JSON schema for consistent structured data output
  - Unified processing replacing rule-based agents
  - Support for PDF, DOCX, TXT, and image files via OCR

### Context Store
- **Purpose**: Manages all persistent data storage using SQLite with hybrid V1.3 schema
- **Implementation**: context_store.py with the ContextStore class
- **Key Functions**:
  - V1.3 schema with both legacy compatibility and modern JSON structure
  - CRUD operations for patients, sessions, documents, and agent outputs
  - Hybrid column support: `document_type` for UI, `extracted_data` for cognitive agent
  - Audit trail management and comprehensive metadata storage

### Watcher Service with Triage Architecture
- **Purpose**: Monitors watch folder and manages file processing pipeline using separated responsibilities
- **Implementation**: watcher_service.py with NewFileHandler class and process_inbox_file function
- **Architecture**: "Triage" design that completely eliminates race conditions by separating file watching from processing
- **Two-Phase Operation**:
  - **Simple Watcher**: NewFileHandler immediately moves files from watch folder to inbox folder with no processing logic
  - **Timer-Based Processor**: Main loop checks inbox folder every 15 seconds and processes files through complete IDIS pipeline
- **Key Features**:
  - No race conditions - system refuses to participate in timing conflicts with scanner software
  - Temporary file filtering (ignores .tmp files from scanner)
  - Inbox folder serves as processing queue
  - Files are deleted from inbox after successful processing and archiving
  - Integration with start_watcher.sh script for Dell testing setup
  - Robust error handling and comprehensive logging

### Database Schema
The SQLite database includes the following key tables:
1. **patients**: Stores patient information with fields like patient_id, patient_name, and timestamps
2. **sessions**: Tracks user sessions with metadata
3. **documents**: Stores document information, linked to patients and sessions
4. **outputs**: Records agent processing outputs
5. **audit_log**: Tracks all system activities for compliance and debugging

### Testing Framework
Unit tests for the Context Store are implemented in tests/test_context_store.py, using Python's unittest framework.

## Data Flow - Unified Cognitive Processing with V1 HITL Workflow
1. Documents are added to a designated "watchfolder" 
2. The Watcher Service detects new files and moves them to a processing folder with unique timestamped filenames
3. **UnifiedIngestionAgent** processes documents through complete LLM-powered pipeline:
   - Text extraction from PDF, DOCX, TXT, and image files (via OCR)
   - **CognitiveAgent** sends text to OpenAI GPT-4o API for structured data extraction
   - V1.3 JSON schema output with comprehensive document metadata
   - Storage of both raw text and structured JSON data in Context Store
   - **V1 HITL Logic**: Documents with ambiguous categorization are flagged with `processing_status = 'pending_categorization'`
4. Data is persisted with hybrid schema supporting legacy UI and modern JSON structure
5. **Human-in-the-Loop Review**: Documents requiring manual review can be processed through the UI using `update_document_categorization()` method
6. All operations are logged in the audit trail with comprehensive error handling
7. Authorized users can retrieve processed information through the QuantaIQ Streamlit interface with enhanced search capabilities

## External Dependencies
The system has minimal external dependencies for the MVP:
- Python 3.11 (as specified in .replit)
- SQLite (embedded database)
- Standard Python libraries: sqlite3, json, uuid, datetime

For future phases, additional dependencies may include:
- OCR libraries for document text extraction
- NLP libraries for advanced text processing
- External APIs for specialized analysis

## Deployment Strategy

- **July 2025**: **CRITICAL FILING BUG FIX** - Fixed TaggerAgent file location detection failure in inbox workflow: agent now searches multiple potential file locations (inbox, watch folders) instead of only looking at original_watchfolder_path, resolving "FILING FAILED" errors and preventing documents from being incorrectly moved to holding folder
- **July 2025**: **CRITICAL DATABASE BUG FIX** - Fixed IngestionAgent database persistence failure caused by attempting to update non-existent 'ocr_confidence_percent' column, preventing extracted text from being saved and causing documents to incorrectly move to holding folder
- **July 2025**: **CRITICAL PIPELINE FIX COMPLETE** - Diagnosed and fixed column name mismatch that was breaking text flow through the pipeline: synchronized all agents to use 'full_text' column consistently (IngestionAgent saves to full_text, ClassifierAgent/SummarizerAgent/TaggerAgent read from full_text), eliminating the bug where extracted text wasn't reaching downstream agents
- **July 2025**: **MODULAR ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE** - Transformed IDIS into a multi-module platform: created modules/ directory structure, moved document search to modules/search_ui.py, implemented Medicaid Navigator UI at modules/medicaid_navigator/ui.py, and converted app.py into application router with sidebar module selection for scalable platform expansion
- **July 2025**: **COMPREHENSIVE FIX COMPLETE** - Implemented robust competitive PDF extraction strategy in both IngestionAgent and UnifiedIngestionAgent with correct return formats: IngestionAgent returns (text, confidence) tuple while UnifiedIngestionAgent returns text string, both agents always perform direct text extraction AND OCR then intelligently select the result with more content, definitively solving mixed-content PDF processing failures
- **July 2025**: Critical data loss prevention fix implemented with two-part solution: removed TaggerAgent text validation block that was skipping documents, added conditional cleanup in watcher service to only delete files after successful archiving, failed files now moved to holding folder for manual inspection
